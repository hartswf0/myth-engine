# Global Film Hubs: A Probabilistic Tug-of-War with Mythic Archetypes
This project models the world’s film hubs as both causal systems and cultural myths. Using a probabilistic framework inspired by Tenenbaum, real headlines are treated as “matches” that update each hub’s inferred strength (tax incentives, infrastructure, market access, output). Using Barthes’ myth lens, each hub carries a narrative aura (glamour, heritage, underdog, hustle) that explains why industry dynamics feel like epic storytelling. The result is a dual-layer map: inner rings visualize probabilistic strength; outer rings encode mythic archetypes. The interactive deck lets users compare hubs, replay recent “tug-of-war” matches (e.g., Marvel Georgia→UK; K-content surge; Canada’s tax credits), and see how beliefs shift over time.

Global Film Hubs: Probabilistic Tug-of-War and Mythic Archetypes - A hybrid model combining Tenenbaum's probabilistic reasoning with Barthes' mythological analysis

## The Hybrid Framework in Action

### Actual Headlines as Probabilistic Updates

Each major industry headline functions as a "tug-of-war match" that updates our beliefs about hub strength:

**Georgia's Decline (Probabilistic Strength: 0.35)**

- "Marvel leaves Georgia to film in UK — gutting state's movie industry" (NY Post, 2025)
- "Georgia film spending plummets 37% after strikes" (AJC, 2024)
- **Mythic Narrative**: Fall of the Scrappy Underdog

**South Korea's Rise (Probabilistic Strength: 0.80)**

- "Korean content on Netflix ranked 2nd in global views" (Korea.net, 2025)
- "South Korean Content Second Only To U.S. In Netflix's Global" (Deadline, 2025)
- **Mythic Narrative**: Precision \& Soft Power Ascendant

**Canada's Growth (Probabilistic Strength: 0.75)**

- "B.C. budget increases Canadian content tax credit to 40%" (Vancouver Sun, 2025)
- **Mythic Narrative**: Efficient Mimic Adapts and Grows


### The Eight Global Wrestling Characters

Each hub embodies both quantitative strength factors and cultural archetypes:

1. **Hollywood** (Gold Star): Eternal Glamour - 85% strength, stable
2. **South Korea** (Taeguk): Precision \& Soft Power - 80% strength, surging
3. **Canada** (Maple Leaf): Efficient Mimic - 75% strength, growing
4. **India** (Peacock): Excess \& Spectacle - 70% strength, recovering
5. **UK** (Crown): Heritage \& Craft - 65% strength, mixed signals
6. **Nigeria** (Drum): Hustle \& Speed - 60% strength, rising
7. **China** (Great Wall): Closed Empire - 40% strength, declining
8. **Georgia** (Barn Star): Scrappy Underdog - 35% strength, declining

## Key Tug-of-War Match Results

The interactive presentation reveals five major competitive dynamics:

**Marvel: Georgia vs UK** → UK Victory

- Evidence: Production relocation to UK studios
- Narrative: "Heritage defeats Underdog"

**Tax Incentives: Canada vs Georgia** → Canada Victory

- Evidence: Canada raised credits to 40% while Georgia lost Marvel
- Narrative: "Northern Mimic outbids Southern Scrappy"

**Global Content: South Korea vs India** → South Korea Victory

- Evidence: 8-9% of global Netflix hours vs India's domestic focus
- Narrative: "Precision defeats Spectacle through efficiency"

**Investment Flow: Nigeria vs Traditional Hubs** → Nigeria Victory

- Evidence: 125% revenue growth, major investor attention
- Narrative: "Hustle challenges Establishment through innovation"

**Market Access: Hollywood vs China** → Hollywood Victory

- Evidence: Studios resist censorship, skip China releases
- Narrative: "Glamour maintains independence from Empire"


## The Meta-Insight

This hybrid model reveals that **successful policy analysis requires both frameworks**:

- **Tenenbaum's PLoT** explains how we rationally update beliefs based on evidence
- **Barthes' Mythologies** explains why audiences emotionally invest in hub "characters"

Headlines simultaneously function as:

1. **Data points** updating probabilistic beliefs about competitive positioning
2. **Mythic narratives** reinforcing cultural archetypes that make economics feel like storytelling

The result is a more complete understanding of how global industries actually operate—not just as rational economic systems, but as ongoing cultural dramas where mathematical probabilities and mythic storytelling combine to shape outcomes.
